	<h2>Seed Harvesting</h2>
	<br>
	<img src="./projects/garden/stoplight-pepper.jpg" alt="Bell Pepper ripening." width="300" height="563.4" class="floatleft">
	<p>Let me tell you something true, ya'll.  I love saving money and I love gardening.  Nothing really makes you feel like you are a kick-ass, resourceful wild-woman quite like those two things.  And it's even more amazing when you can accomplish both those things in one super, awesome trick.</p>
	<p>Seed harvesting does just that.  And you'd be surprised what you can continue to reap the benefits of with just a little bit of time and effort.  There is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzZzZ_qpZ4w" style="text-decoration: none; display: inline; font-size: 1em; color: blue;">TED talk</a> I watched recently that says something along these lines, mentioning that, "growing your own food like printing your own money."  I couldn't agree more.</p>
	<p>For example, last year I bought a few stoplight peppers from the local grocery store.  I remember thinking as I was preparing them for dinner later that week that while I normally just throw the seeds, core, and membranes away, what would happen if I saved the seeds for planting?  Would anything come of it?</p>
	<p>On a whim, I decided to save those seeds. I rinsed them and dried them out and set about doing just a little bit of research online. What I read gave some conflicting answers: some said yes, but they won't be exactly like what you bought. Others said that if they do manage to germinate, they likely won't fruit. And still others said no way, absolutely not. I was still no closer to knowing the answer.</p>
	<p>So, being the scientist I am, of course I had to test it out. Granted, I probably should have tested it along with a store bought seed control group, but, quite frankly, I didn't want to grow <em>that</em> many bell peppers.  Variety is the spice of life, after all. So I made due with a few Banana Pepper plants to act as a sort of control.</p>
	<p>So I started the seeds indoors in the very early Spring.  To my delight, they did germinate! (Everyone say WooHoo!!)  I transplanted them outdoors when it was warm enough and waited...</p>
	<img src="./projects/garden/cute-pepper.jpg" alt="The cutest stuffed peppers." width="403.2" height="302.4" class="floatright" style="transform: rotate(90deg); margin-bottom: 4em; margin-top: 4em;">
	<p>I checked them frequently whenever I was out.  By midsummer, I already had gotten quite a few harvests from my Banana Peppers, so I began to think that maybe Research Result Number 2 was the correct one: they might germinate, but nothing will really come from it. Still, I was satisfied with the greenery and satiating my curiousity.</p>
	<p>It was early Autumn that I saw the buds appearing on those store-bought Bell Pepper plants and I was holding my breath that they actually would fruit. Waiting at this point was both exciting and excruciating, but finally, to my delight, they began to fruit!</p>
	<p>Horray! I was so pleased! I called them my Impossible Peppers and I can't tell you how proud I was to have grown these not only from seed, but from the leftovers of a dinner so many months ago.  I bought those peppers last year as a three pack for $1.69.  That normally would've been used in a single meal.  And with minimal effort, I was able to stretch that into at least three.</p>
	<p>The last harvest I took from my Impossible Peppers was just before the frost this year, so I made sure to take every size pepper that was still growing: even the mini acorn sized ones.  I know, it's ridiculous, but hey, look at how cute those baby stuffed peppers are!</p>
	<p>The point I'm really trying to say here is if you got any sized yard, I urge you to try it out for yourself.  It doesn't have to be peppers: try it for anything you might like (assuming a non-invasive or other ecologically dangerous species). Heck, I certainly don't limit myself: I often go on walks locally or visit a family's garden and find myself collecting a taking seeds home (with permission, of course).</p>
	<p>It's a great way to stretch the dollar, dig out and brush off that bit of resourcefulness buried in your soul, and really feel proud that you've taken a step to becoming more sustainable. Happy gardening, everyone!</p>

	<h2> Country Ribs </h2>
	<p>Let’s talk about Country Ribs.</p>
	<br>
	<img src="./projects/cookingbaking/countryribs-stove.jpg" alt="Country Ribs on the Stove." class="floatright" width="403.2" height="302.4" style="transform: rotate(90deg); margin-bottom: 4em;">
	<p>This cut typically comes from the shoulder, but sometimes comes from the loin.  This cut of ribs tend to have the most meat.  There are many ways to prepare ribs, but since it is fall and because apples are delicious, I’m going to share with you a recipe that we’ve been really enjoying this season.</p>
	<br>
	<p>First off, you need the following ingredients:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>1 to 2 lbs of Country Style Ribs</li>
		<li>1 to 2 baking apples, sliced</li>
		<li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
		<li>2 Tablespoons of Rosemary, or to taste</li>
		<li>Some oil, to lubricate the pan</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Let’s get to cooking!</p>
	<dl>
		<dd>Put some oil in the pan and start heating it up over medium high heat.</dd>
		<dd>Once the pan is at a medium high heat and the oil is shimmering, add the Ribs.</dd>
		<dd>When the ribs start browning, add the onion, apples, and half the Rosemary.</dd>
		<dd>As the browning is visibly coming an eighth to a quarter of the way up the side of the rib, flip them to the opposite side.</dd>
		<dd>Add the rest of the Rosemary.</dd>
		<dd>Feel free to flip the ribs onto the sides that haven’t started browning.  It is best to try to get some colour onto each side.</dd>
		<dd>When the internal temperature of the pork rib is at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit, but hopefully no more than 160 degrees Fahrenheit.</dd>
		<dd>Rest the pork ribs for 3 minutes</dd>
		<dd>Serve with rice, salad, or mixed vegetables.</dd>
	</dl>
	<br>
	<p>We’ve been enjoying this recipe so much, we’ve made it multiple times this season.  It cooks quickly, and can be fast enough to prepare in the evening after work.  The apples and pork really complement each other very well, and the rosemary really adds a nice balance to the dish.  Another thing that is great about this meal is that it re-heats very well, and can even taste better as the flavours get to know each other in the fridge.</p>
	<br>
	<p>We would highly recommend this dish, and hope that you enjoy it as much as we have!</p>

	<h2>Cleveland, Ohio, 2019</h2>
	<p>Not too long ago, we took an amazing vacation to Colorado.  While we were there, we met up with a friend and had an amazing road-trip visiting every National Park in the state.  Unfortunately, we only planned the trip for a long weekend, so we managed to squeeze this expansive trip into four days.</p>
	<p>But that is a tale for another post.</p>
	<p>However, it was on the way back from this exhaustingly exhilarating trip that we made a goal to visit every National Park in the US.  </p>
	<p>Every. Last. One. Of. Them.</p>
	<p>At the time, we didn’t realize just how many National Parks there are in the US, or appreciate how remote some of them are.  The sheer amount of traveling this endeavor would require made us quickly realize that this goal would definitely have to be upgraded to a lifelong pursuit.</p>
	<p>We choose to look at this as an awesome opportunity to plan and enjoy so many more vacations whenever we get the chance.  Which brings us to this piece in our National Park Vacation Bingo: Cuyahoga Valley National Park.</p>
	<img src="./images/cleveland/day1.jpg" alt="Day 1." width="306.9" height="306.9" class="floatleft">
	<h4><em>Day 1</em></h4>
	<p>The first day was largely focused on driving to Punderson State Park, where we had reserved a cabin for the duration of the trip.  We started out in the morning, and stopped for lunch at the Casselman Inn in Grantsville Maryland.  If you ever happen to be nearby, it is highly recommended that you stop in and grab a bite if you can.</p>
	<p>We also took a break at the Forks of Cheat Winery and Distillery.  While we did not stay very long, and it was out of the way, the spirits that we were able to sample we very tasty.  We ended up taking home a bottle of their whiskey and a bottle of their brandy.</p>
	<p>After hours of travel, we arrived at Punderson State Park in the early evening, and were able to check into our cabin.  It ended up being a two bedroom affair, with one of the rooms having a bunk bed.  It also a nice kitchenette, living area, and had a fully enclosed porch with a view of the lake.</p>
	<img src="./images/cleveland/day2.jpg" alt="Day 1." width="306.9" height="306.9" class="floatright">
	<h4><em>Day 2</em></h4>
	<p>On our first day in Ohio, the weather was threatening to rain.  Actually, the weather forecast wasn’t looking too great for the whole week.  We decided that our first day should be spent visiting one of the indoor attractions in the city that we had planned on.  We got in the car and headed toward Cleveland.  First things first, we stopped at a placed called Lucky’s Cafe for some breakfast.  Beaces got the Shipwreck, which is a blend of hash browns, eggs, veggies, bacon and cheddar cheese served with toast and fruit.  Ktbug got the biscuits and gravy, which were cheddar scallion biscuits topped with soft scrambled eggs and sausage gravy with hash browns and grapes on the side.  The coffee was pretty good too.  It was a phenomenal way to start the day!</p>
	<p>The next stop was the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  We went in and got our tickets all squared away, and then proceeded to rock out!  It was a great experience seeing the evolution of Rock and Roll progress as we worked our way through the museum.  The also had a temporary pinball machine exhibit set up, which was a lot of fun to experience.</p>
	<p>After we had experienced the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, we still had some time before we wanted to head back to our cabin.  We found that the International Women’s Air and Space Museum was just a short walk away.  While it wasn’t a very large museum, existing in the lobby of the Burke Lakefront Airport, the exhibits were interesting and informative.  We had dinner and drinks at the Market Garden Brewery, located next door to the famous West Side Market.  The beer was good and the perogies were appetizing.  Before heading out of town, we stopped off at Nano Brew, which is a brewpub run by the Market Garden Brewery to produce small batch runs of beer to see what works, and what doesn’t.  All in all, it was a great start to our vacation!</p>
	<img src="./images/cleveland/day3.jpg" alt="Day 1." width="306.9" height="306.9" class="floatleft">
	<h4><em>Day 3</em></h4>
	<p>On day 3, the weather report was in our favour. It was time to go to Cuyahoga Valley National Park.  We drove into the park and headed toward the Ritchie Ledges.  They’re really interesting geological structures!  The trail started off going through these gorgeous trees at the top of the structure, and then you wind down among these sandstone cliffs, all leading up to an overlook.  It was such a scenic hike, we would definitely recommend it.  On our way out of the park, we stopped by the Boston Store Visitor Center.</p>
	<p>After that we headed over to the Tinkers Creek Gorge Scenic Overlook, which is part of the Cleveland Metroparks system.  We were able to find a nearby trail that headed off into the woods a bit, that ended up at the bottom of this tall retaining wall.   After we went down the trail a bit, we decided it was time to head back to the car and go find something to eat and drink.</p>
	<p>On our way back to the cabin, we stopped off at Mad Cap Brew Co and got dinner at a Swensons Drive-In.</p>
	<img src="./images/cleveland/day4.jpg" alt="Day 1." width="306.9" height="306.9" class="floatright">
	<h4><em>Day 4</em></h4>
	<p>On the fourth day, we headed back into Cleveland to visit the Great Lakes Science Center, which also acts as the visitor center for the NASA Glenn Research Center.  There were many interactive displays and hands on exhibits.  While the designers of the exhibits were probably focusing on a younger audience then people in their late twenties, they were still interesting and engaging.</p>
	<p>After the museum closed for the day, we wandered off to find something to drink.  We ended up at Bookhouse Brewing.   Not only are they a brewery, Bookhouse Brewing is also a free library!  That means that every book that you can see in the brewery is free to take, with the hope being that you bring one or more to replace it and keep the catalog interesting.  It just so happened that when we visited they were also hosting some puppies from the local animal shelter.  They were real sweet hearts!</p>
	<p>Once we had our drinks and a light snack, we headed over to Slyman’s Tavern for dinner.  Slyman’s Tavern is known for their corned beef sandwiches.   We got one sandwich and an order of perogies.  The sandwich is probably the largest one I have ever seen.  It is just a massive pile of meat between two slices of rye bread.  The perogies were also great, and were served  with grilled onions, sour cream, and applesauce.  They were glorious.</p>
	<img src="./images/cleveland/day5.jpg" alt="Day 1." width="306.9" height="306.9" class="floatleft">
	<h4><em>Day 5</em></h4>
	<p>The last was all about the journey back.  We woke up, got some coffee, turned in the keys to the cabin, and hit up the gift shop on our way out of Punderson State Park.  Just a hop, skip, and a jump from the park, we stopped off at the site of Neil Armstrong’s first flight.  While they installed a K-Mart where the actual airfield was, there is a monument built.  In 2003, they installed a roughly ½ scale replica of the Apollo 11 lunar lander, as well as other replica rockets and plaques commemorating Ohio’s rich aeronautics history.</p>
	<p>For breakfast we stopped off at Heggy’s in Salem Ohio.  We got a filling breakfast with coffee, and several pounds of candy for friends and family back home.  Then, we were off to Pittsburgh!  We stopped off at The Church Brew Works for some beer and lunch.  The old church has been converted into a brewery, and it’s just such a great place.  They have several stain glass windows, painted murals, high ceilings.  The beer was pretty good too!</p>
	<p>After lunch, we headed back out onto the road.  We drove for hours, out into the middle of nowhere.  Then, finally, we reached our next destination.  The Coffee Pot.  The Coffee Pot is a large, oversized building shaped like a coffee pot.  It was built as a way to attract visitors to the gas station next door.  In the current era, the coffee pot has actually been moved away from its original location and restored to it’s former glory.  We’re still not sure if it was worth the drive.</p>
	<p>We finally returned home late at night, unpacked the car, and headed straight to bed.</p>

		<h2>Fixing our LED light strip!</h2>
		<p>We started picking up some cheap LED strips from Wal Mart. They're roughly 5 dollars a piece, and are intended to go behind televisions to add ambience.  We didn't get them for that though, but for a few projects that will be covered in a couple different posts in the future.</p>
		<p>Anyway, much to my dismay, one of the first strips that was purchased wouldn't take any input from the remote.  Instead of returning it, I decided to remove the heat shrink tubing from the control PCB to see what it looked like.  I noticed that the IR receiver had a shorted connection.  I was able to clean that up and now the remote works.</p>
		<p>Now if only we knew why hitting the "off" button turns the colour to green...</p>

	<p>A couple years ago we were happy to celebrate our nephew's baptism.  We stayed with him and his family the night before so that we could be there early for the Sunday service.  I snapped this photo while we were all getting ready the following morning. Let me tell you, this baby had no clue what to make of his beard and would just stare in fascination! It was too cute <em>not</em> to turn into a portrait!</p>
	<p>And it just so happens that in November of 2019 we also got to see our sweet neice's baptism!  I got some great shots, and plan to make the next portrait coming up!</p>
